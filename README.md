# Overview
This project implements an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for the Rick and Morty API data using Apache Airflow. The pipeline extracts character, location, and episode data from the Rick and Morty API, transforms it, stores it in PostgreSQL, and visualizes it using Power BI. The entire solution is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
